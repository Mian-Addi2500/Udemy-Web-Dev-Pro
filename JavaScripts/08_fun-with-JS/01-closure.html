    // what is closure?
    // Closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer function's variables.
    // It allows the inner function to "remember" the environment in which it was created, even after the outer function has finished executing.

    // Closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function's scope, and the global scope.
    // Closure is created when a function is defined inside another function.

    // for understanding closure, we need to understand lexical scoping first.
    // Lexical scoping is a way of defining the scope of variables in JavaScript.
    // In JavaScript, a variable's scope is determined by its position in the source code, which is known as lexical scoping.

    // example of lexical scoping: üîª

    function parent() {
      let name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by parent

      //   console.log("parent", secret); // this will throw an error because secret is not defined in this scope of parent function

      function childOne() {
        // childOne() is the inner function, that forms a closure
        let secret = "123abc";
        console.log("child 1", name); // use variable declared in the parent function

        // now we create another inner function in childOne
        function grandChild() {
          console.log("grand child", name); // this will work because grandChild has access to the parent's scope
          console.log("grand child", secret); // this will work because grandChild has access to the child's scope
        }
        grandChild(); // call the grandChild function
      }
      function childTwo() {
        console.log("child 2", name);

        // console.log("child 2", secret); // this will throw an error because secret is not defined in this scope
      }
      childOne(); // call the inner function
      childTwo(); // call the second inner function
    }
    parent(); // Output: Mozilla

    // üî∫ this is our [lexical scoping]

    // ‚ö°‚ö°now let's see how closure works with the above example‚ö°‚ö°

    function makeFunc() {
      const name = "Mozilla";
      function displayName() {
        console.log(name);
      }
      //   displayName(); we did not run this bcz we return the fn() when we store the makeFunc in a variableand then run that variable

      // when we call makeFunc, it returns the displayName function, which has access to the name variable
      // it means when we return displayName, it forms a closure which means it also pass all things in function too which are in the scope of makeFunc not only the displayName function
      return displayName;
    }
    // when we store the [makeFunc] function in a variable, it will return the displayName function
    // and when we call that variable, it will execute the displayName function which has access to the name variable from the makeFunc scope.
    // this is how closure works in JavaScript
    const myFunc = makeFunc();
    myFunc();

    // ü™êü™ênow we see its Practical implimitation or realword secnireo when you use this in your work

    // for this make an other [script] tag in the html file and write this code in that script tag
  </script>
  <script>
    // Practical implimitation of closure
    // this is a simple example of how closure works in JavaScript
    // we will create a function that will change the bg-color of the button when clicked

    // ‚≠ê this is basic example of dom which we study in the previous chapter üîª

    // document.getElementById("orange").onclick = function () {
    //   document.body.style.backgroundColor = "orange";
    // };
    // document.getElementById("green").onclick = function () {
    //   document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green";
    // };

    // but we want to give function to onclick event of the button

    // let see how üîª

    function changeColor(color) {
      //   document.body.style.backgroundColor = color;
      // üî∫ this will not work
      //   return (document.body.style.backgroundColor = color);
      // üî∫ this will also not work when we return

      //   now we will return a function that will change the bg-color of the body and now we will give it to the onclick event of the button

      // and this is our closure concepts comes in real work

      return function () {
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = `${color}`;
        // this function has access to the color variable from the changeColor function's lexical scope using closure
        // so when we call this function, it will change the bg-color of the body too
      };
    }

    document.querySelector("#orange").onclick = changeColor("orange");
    document.querySelector("#green").onclick = changeColor("green");
  </script>
