//ðŸ’ŽArray BasicsðŸ’Ž

//1st way of creting an array which is mostly used ðŸ”»

const myArr = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15];

// 2nd way of array decleration ðŸ”»

const myArr2 = new Array(21, 22, 23, 24, 25);

// we access the element of array by its index number ðŸ”»

// console.log(myArr[0]);

// ðŸ”º output : 11

//ðŸ’  Array use the approch of [Shallow copy] mean share the same referance point like [Heap] if something chnges the orignal array should be effected mean changes

//ðŸ’ŽArray MethodsðŸ’Ž

myArr.push(6);
//ðŸ”ºthis method simply add element at the end of array and it is [mostly used]
myArr.pop();
//ðŸ”ºthis method simply remove element at the end of array and it is not required any arrgument
myArr.unshift(0);
//ðŸ”ºthis method simply add element at the start of array and it shift all array values and this is time cunsuming process and our computer should feel load
myArr.shift();
//ðŸ”ºthis method simply remove element at the start of array it is not required any arrgument

// ðŸ’ now we see some [questioner method] to array mean we just simply question to an array and it will give us answer in Boolen

// console.log(myArr.includes(9));
//ðŸ”ºoutput : false
// console.log(myArr.indexOf(13));
//ðŸ”ºoutput : 2 => this means that 13 is at 2 index in our myArr array

// This method is mostly used

const newArr = myArr.join();
// ðŸ”º this method will [change our array to string] with ',' seprated
// console.log(myArr);
//ðŸ”ºoutput :[ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ] => this is array
// console.log(newArr);
//ðŸ”ºoutput :11,12,13,14,15 => this string with ',' seprated

// ðŸ’ Now concept of [Slice and Splice] ðŸ”»

// console.log("A", myArr);
// ðŸ”º output : A [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ]
// Slice ðŸ”»

let myn1 = myArr.slice(1, 3);
// console.log("B", myArr);
// ðŸ”º output : B [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ]
// console.log(myn1);
// ðŸ”º output : [12, 13]
// ðŸ”ºIn Slice fist Index Range includes and last not includes and Orignal array does not effected

// Splice ðŸ”»

let myn2 = myArr.splice(1, 3);

// console.log("C", myArr);
// ðŸ”º output : C [ 11, 15 ]
// console.log(myn2);
// ðŸ”º output : [ 12, 13, 14 ]

// ðŸ”ºIn Splice fist Index Range includes and also last includes but the Orignal array  effected  the remining index values remaines in the Orignal array

// ðŸ’ Let see another methods of an Array ðŸ”»

const marvel_heros = ["thor", "Ironman", "spiderman"];
const dc_heros = ["superman", "flash", "batman"];

// now we want to merge both array into single array so for this we think 1st that we us [.push] method . so let try and see what should comesðŸ”»

// marvel_heros.push(dc_heros);
// console.log(marvel_heros);
// ðŸ”ºoutput : [ 'thor', 'Ironman', 'spiderman', [ 'superman', 'flash', 'batman' ] ] => which is not we acpected bcz we want to merge our array not array with in an array as element

// let in our above concept if we want to access [flash] what we do let see ðŸ”»

// console.log(marvel_heros[3][1]);

// ðŸ”º output : flash => this is also work but it is not good practes

// ðŸ’ now another way to get our desier outputðŸ”»

// concat method

// const all_heros = marvel_heros.concat(dc_heros);

// console.log(all_heros);

// ðŸ”ºoutput : [ 'thor', 'Ironman', 'spiderman', 'superman', 'flash', 'batman' ] => now this is what we want and in this concept we also learn that [concat return new array] but push does not

// ðŸ’ but there is an another easy way to get our desier output which mostly people use is called [sepred operator]ðŸ”»

const allNewHeros = [...marvel_heros, ...dc_heros];
console.log(allNewHeros);

// ðŸ”ºoutput : [ 'thor', 'Ironman', 'spiderman', 'superman', 'flash', 'batman' ] =>which give same result like concate but mostly people prefer this that why we use it mostly

// Now we understand another concept of array which we use [raearly]ðŸ”»

const anotherArray = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], 7, [6, 7, [4, 5]]];

const myRealArray = anotherArray.flat(Infinity);
console.log(myRealArray);
// ðŸ”ºoutput :[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 4, 5] => by this all values comes in to single array by using [flat] and [flat] also get [depth] that at what depth I solve the array but we use infinity so it automatically take all depth range

// Now we understand another concept of array which we use [Mostly] speacily when we [data scraping ]form any web pageðŸ”»

// when we select the data from any web page then it was many time in diff formate like nodelist,objects or string form the data comes but we whan an array bcz we loop through an array so how we convert this data formate in to an array let see ðŸ”»

console.log(Array.isArray("Adil"));

// ðŸ”ºoutput : false => so first we Question that is ['adil'] is array so the answer is [false] bcz it is string not array

// so how to convert this [string] into an array let see ðŸ”»

console.log(Array.from("Adil"));

// ðŸ”ºoutput : [ 'A', 'd', 'i', 'l' ] => jo b value hm dean gy ya us ko array mn convert kr dy ga

// let see if we give [object] to convert it or array ðŸ”»

console.log(Array.from({ name: "adil" }));
// ðŸ”ºoutput : [] =>bcz [.from] do not directly convert object into array for this we first conform that is we want [array of keys or values] then it will give results if it not convert then it will always give an empty array

// now same like above we see another exemple that ðŸ”»

let scor1 = 100;
let scor2 = 200;
let scor3 = 300;

// like this situation also comes that if we have multiple variables or arrays then we also to convert in to array so we also easily convert it insted of using[.from] we also use [.of] this also returns a new array from a set of elements now set elemtns shuold be array or variables e.t.c let see how to converts all elementsðŸ”»

console.log(Array.of(scor1, scor2, scor3));
// ðŸ”ºoutput : [ 100, 200, 300 ]
