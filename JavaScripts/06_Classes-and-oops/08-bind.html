    // ‚≠êIn this we study about bind using react exampl‚≠ê

    //Actually in early days of react  they use bundlers in react but we  suppose react made a [class] behind the scene and some methods they write themselves but remaing we write manually let see how they give us react class

    class React {
      constructor() {
        this.library = "React";
        this.server = "https://localhost:3000";
        // üî∫this was basic made for us in react

        // now in constructor we have to declear other methods to [constractor ky elawa]

        // now in our case our [requrement] that I want when this page reload an automatically an object created

        // now we have 2 part of requrement that 1) we get referance of that button and 2) we have h method that is [handelClick] that give us message that on click the button it give some message . so let see how we will do üîª

        // now what i do in this constructor bcz we create new object then it will give us refrence of all values in constructor so for this we write some manual code

        document
          .querySelector("button")
          .addEventListener("click", this.handleClick.bind(this));

        // üî∫  when we use [bind and also give [this] in it ] then we access [server] mean [constructor] values otherwise without [bind] we did not access [constructor] values then we only access [handleClick] method. That's why in early days we use concept of [bind] and also get the current context in it which is [this] same as [call] which we study previous
      }
      //   this is our [handelClick] method

      handleClick() {
        console.log(`Button CLicked`);
        console.log(this.server);
      }
    }

    const app = new React();
